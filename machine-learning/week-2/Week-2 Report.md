# Week-2 Report

I couldnâ€™t do much this week because I was really ill ðŸ˜­ I am submitting whatever I could do but Iâ€™ll try to do more on this project in the next week along with the week-3 project. :(

### Approach:

I first did EDA, data preprocessing, data cleaning and feature engineering. Then I checked whether the sales data was stationary or not using ADFuller Test. Turned out that the data was stationary. I looked at the trend of the sales data and after that I implemented SARIMA and Prophet for time series forecasting. After this Iâ€™ll try to apply SARIMAX to take into account exogenous features.

### Challenges:

This wee turned out to be lot more harder than week-1 because there were lots of new concepts and topics which I didnâ€™t know about. Had to put in alot of efforts to learn those concepts but then the implementation was not that difficult (for whatever little work I was able to do this week). I am aware that what work I have done in this project is very little and I am quite sure that there are several challenges that are yet to be faced.

### Results:

Prophet and ARIMA both seem to give reasonably good predictions. But it looks like ARIMA is giving a better result.
